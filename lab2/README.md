# QA. Python, Sem1, Assignment_2

The second assignment is based on https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QtzuIKQLm5YrSG8txEga43X_fHGs-UR89_9YroK4psA/

So, in order to be able work on the second assignment you need to have the final working version of the first assignment.

In terms of the current assignment you need to develop the HTTP (Restful) application that will allow you to run absolutely the same commands like in the previous assignment using HTTP protocol.

The next resources should be defined:

- /directory
- /binaryfile
- /logtextfile
- /bufferfile

The assignment should be done step by step:
- Create a prototype of the system (this is just signatures of functions without implementation. It is not possible to create tests if you don’t do this step. But this is not full implementation)
- Create Tests (PyTest or Robot)
- Provide implementation
- Bugfixes

So, there should be at least 4 commits.
